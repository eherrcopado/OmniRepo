<br> </br>
We’ve revamped Service Analytics so you can add, edit, and delete the out-of-the-box dashboards. Just point- and-click to customize dashboard elements without writing a line of code. Additional enhancements--including pages, global filters and dynamic time period selectors--make the app faster and more precise than ever.
<br> </br>
The Service Analytics app gets you started fast with Analytics and provides a clear path through your Service Cloud data on any device. Whether you’re a service manager or agent, you get everything you need in one place to uncover key data insights to help you grow your business.
<br> </br>
<h2><b> New With this Release </b></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Point and Click Editing.</b> Service Analytics has been reworked to allow for easier editing of dashboards. Add, edit, and delete any part of a dashboard without ever having to touch any code.</li>

  <li><b>Improved customization and performance with global filters.</b> To optimize performance and make dashboards even easier to customize, the dashboards listed below now use global filters instead of list widget filters. You can add, edit, or remove filters by editing the global filter panel. And dashboards load more quickly because global filters require fewer queries than the previous list widgets.</li>

  <li><b>Cleaner, fast-loading dashboards.</b> We’ve used Analytics pages to streamline dashboard content. Toggle between segmentation breakdown and case detail views in the dashboards listed below.</li>

  <li><b>Reduced complexity with standard date picker, connected datasets.</b> We’ve switched from a custom data range picker to the standard date picker as part of the global filter. This removes the need for creating bindings with JSON code, which simplifies dashboard customization. Additionally, we’ve used the Analytics Connect Data Source feature to join datasets used in the Open Cases and Account Profile dashboards. Previously, these dashboards required bindings, which added complexity and slowed performance.</li>
</ul>
